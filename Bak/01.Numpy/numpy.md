* Numpy is fast & has bindings to **C** libraries.

* Installation: <br> `conda install numpy` or <br> `pip install numpy`

* There arde essentially **two types** of Numpy arrays: <br>**vectors** and <br>**metrices**

* Vectors are strictly 1-D arrays

* Metrices are 2-D (it can still hold only **one Row** or **one Column**)<br><br><br>

**Topics Covered**

* array
* random
* range
* linspace
* eye
* shape
* dtype
* indexing
* slicing
